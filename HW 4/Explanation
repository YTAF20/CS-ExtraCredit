1. Insertion Sort:
    Best Case: O(n)
    Average Case: O(n^2)
    Worst Case: O(n^2)
    for n
      val 1
      val 1
      while n
        val 1
        val 1
    The while loop will only run if theres something to sort
    so when everything is in the correct position already the time
    complexity is simply O(n) but if anything is unsorted and the
    while laso has to run it becomes O(n^2)



2. Matrix Multiplication
For matrix multiplication since there is a for loop
nested in a for loop which is nested in another for loop
the best worst and average case will be O(n^3)
for( value )  n
  for( value ) n
  sum 1
    for( value ) n
    sum 1
this gets written as (n*n*n + 2) which is equal to O(n^3) and since the only way these for loops get avoided in the code is by throwing an error it will always be O(n^3)
