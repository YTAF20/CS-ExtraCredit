Part 1:
    1.n^3 as the constant in front of n^2 has no real sway over our
    answer
    2.n^2(logn) is greater than 10nlogn as n^2 grows faster than n
    3.n^logn should grow faster because even though logn grows a lot slower
    than sqrt n the base is growing a lot faster than the constant 2
    4.(2^n)^2 should grow faster than 2^n
Part 2:
    Best Case: O(1)
    Worst Case: O(n)
    Average Case: O(n)
    Worst and average case occurs when the number is a prime number
    greater than 2 because it will check if its divisible by every
    number less than it up to n-1, but when it's 2 it'll jus return
    true which is why best case is 1
